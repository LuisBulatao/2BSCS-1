# **Movics**
**Project Description**

_Movicss is an innovative web application project developed as a requirement for Mary Jane Lima's course, Design and Analysis of Algorithms. The primary objective of Movicss is to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring various algorithms, including Knapsack, Selection Sorting, TSP (Travelling Salesman Problem), and String Matching_

_The web application features a responsive design, making it accessible across devices. Users can seamlessly navigate through different algorithm categories, access detailed explanations, and manipulate parameters to observe algorithmic behavior in real-time._

### Homa Page
_When launching the app, users will be directed to the home page, where their current location is prominently displayed. From this point, they are provided with the option to generate an order and set the maximum weight limit for their delivery preferences._

### KnapSack
_Once users have gemerated the order and specified the maximum weight, they can access essential information like the address, distance, and knapsack details associated with the generated order._

### Travelling Salesman Problem
_In this section, users can navigate both the shortest and longest paths to reach their delivery destination. They have the flexibility to choose between these path based on their preferences and requirements._
![TSP](https://github.com/LuisBulatao/2BSCS-1/assets/115807743/9ecb2f15-85d0-4363-8b6c-8297247bf370)

### Selection Sort
_Next, the sorting list displays the order number, address, and delivery date for user convenience. This organized presentation enables users to easily manage their orders, ensuring efficient tracking and timely delivery_

### String Matching
_Finally, in this section, users have the capability to search for addresses. Upon entering their desired address, the system will display results that closely match the user's input, facilitating ease of navigation and ensuring accurate delivery destinations_
